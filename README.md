## General Information
The project is aimed at creating a product for companies of various sizes that need to organize work for their teams. Our tool will enable a flexible division of tasks for each team member, the ability to control the creation of projects, efficient information flow and communication between group participants. The main idea that accompanied us when creating the project was to enable the most effective remote work in the current pandemic conditions. Thanks to our application, companies will not only be able to effectively work remotely, but also facilitate the work of teams in normal office conditions.
